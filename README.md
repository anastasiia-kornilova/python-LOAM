![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/anastasiia-kornilova/python-LOAM/badge?style=plastic)

The repo contains Python implementation of the paper "LOAM: Lidar Odometry And Mapping in Real-time" by Ji Zhang and 
Sanjiv Singh.

[Here](https://github.com/anastasiia-kornilova/loam-impl) you can find detailed information about other LOAM 
implementations and their compatibility with different LiDAR sensors.

Original paper can be found [here](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/2014/7/Ji_LidarMapping_RSS2014_v8.pdf) from 2014.
[There is](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10514-016-9548-2) also an extended version of the paper in
